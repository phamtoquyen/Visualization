# Labs

These labs are designed to teach you the skills needed to create data visualizations on the web. They will help you to learn how to program with the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) toolkit. D3 has become the go-to tool for creating interactive visualizations. D3 leverages existing web technologies in order to bring your interactive visualizations to a global audience via the Web.

### Lab Schedule

Students should work on the labs on their own time. They are intended to teach you the basics of D3 while you are in the design phase of the project. Their due dates are listed on the course syllabus.


### Reading Materials

The labs will generally follow Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e). In the _Prerequisites_ section of each lab, we will list the accompanying chapter or section of the Murray book.
